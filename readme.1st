Please prepare pyocd, if no, please using 'pip install pyocd' to install it.

I will suggest to use python virtualenv to run it.

1. python3 -m venv venv
2. source ./venv/bin/activate
3. pip install pyocd


if need to exit the venv, just type 'deactivate'

next time, you just need type 'source ./venv/bin/activate' to run venv again.
